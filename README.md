## A latent generative model for fast seeded genreration of small molecules

`nebula` is a latent 3D generative model for scalable generation of large molecular libraries around a seed compound of interest. Led by [Ewa Nowara](), [Pedro O. Pinheiro](), [Sai Pooja Mahajan](), [Omar Mahmood](), [Andrew M. Watkins](), [Saeed Saremi](), and [Michael Maser]() at [Prescient Design, Genentech](https://www.gene.com/scientists/our-scientists/prescient-design).


We are currently working with our legal team on releasing the code. Please check back at the end of July 2024.
